# The Bankers Algorithm
The algorithm was created using C++ language.
A while loop in implemented to make unlimited immediate requests without the need to input all the data again.
The original metrics data gets updated only when the immediate request is granted and safe sequence is found (following the lecture).
The implementation can detect if the immediate request is rejected due to the inability to find a safe state or because the requested resources were larger than needed/available resources.
Commented code left to facilitate testing without the need to input every time.
